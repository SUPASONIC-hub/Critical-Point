# Critical Point Work Status

Last updated: 2026-09-02

## Current State

- Core verification passes with `npm run verify`.
- Fast CI checks and heavyweight E2E checks are split in GitHub Actions.
- Visual regression is separated into `npm run test:visual` and a dedicated label-aware workflow.
- Save/recovery, telemetry retry, season flow, accessibility, contrast, text integrity, graph schema, and visual baselines are covered by automated checks.
- Source text is valid UTF-8. Some Windows shells can render Korean incorrectly, so text integrity is guarded by `npm run check:text` instead of manual terminal inspection.
- The Supabase schema is deployed through CLI migrations in `supabase/migrations/`, not by pasting SQL into the dashboard editor.

## Maintenance Priorities

1. Keep `AppContent.jsx` focused on orchestration and move screen contracts into `src/viewModels`.
2. Keep browser-storage ownership in focused hooks such as `useAppPersistence` and `useLocalRanking`.
3. Route guarded button behavior through `GuardedButton` instead of repeating `aria-disabled`, `tabIndex`, and click guards.
4. Put reusable Playwright flow behavior in `tests/helpers/gameFlow.js`.
5. Keep CSS, text, and graph checks budget/schema-based so content drift is caught before it reaches screenshots.
6. Run heavyweight E2E and visual regression separately from default PR verification because browser raster differences can be environment-sensitive.
7. Add schema changes as new files in `supabase/migrations/` so the remote migration history stays authoritative. Never edit the applied baseline in place.
8. Never name a PL/pgSQL variable after a column of a table the same function writes to. `validate_telemetry_insert` did, and the resulting `42702` ambiguity blocked every telemetry insert. Prefix locals with `v_`.
9. Keep anon's read rules on the table, not in a view. `playtest_sessions` pairs an RLS policy (completed season rows) with a column-level grant (no `decision_log`, `session_id` or `id`), so `public_rankings` can stay `security_invoker = true` and any future reader inherits the same limits. A `security_definer` view would work too, but it moves the whole boundary into the view body and Supabase's advisor flags it as critical.

## Verification Commands

```bash
npm run verify
npm run test:visual
```

## Database Deployment

The project is linked and `npx supabase db push` reports it up to date. Apply new
schema changes by adding a migration and pushing it:

```bash
npx supabase migration new <name>
npx supabase db push
```

Credentials come from `supabase/.env.local` (`SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
`SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`), which is ignored by `supabase/.gitignore`. The CLI cannot run
its browser login flow from a non-TTY shell, so the env vars are the only way to drive
it from an agent session.

Caution: when `link` first created the remote history table it recorded both existing
migrations as applied without executing them -- the schema had been applied by hand in
the SQL editor. The history table therefore reflects what `link` inferred, not what the
CLI ran. Always `db push` before trusting `migration list`, and verify behavior against
the live database when a migration fixes a runtime error.
